# Using FiltLong to filter reads to remove the worst 10% of read bases, and any reads smaller than 10 kb
# Note that 10 kb is way too high (just use 1 kb when doing your actual assembly)
# I should also include a --headcrop 50 parameter that removes 50 basepairs from the beginning of each read (this is available in NanoFilt, so use this next time)
# The basecaller used by MinKNOW should have taken care of adapter sequences

# After viewing this in IGV it was found that from the region from ~160 bp upstream of exon1 to 1677 bp past exon3 was missing. This could be because of the following reasons:
# 1. The region is infact missing (large deletion or recombination event) and therefore the 3'UTR and CDS sequences obtained from PCR were due to purple gDNA contamination
# 2. Nanopore could not handle the repeditive AT sequences and the overall AT-richness of this region, and thus it was not sequenced
# 3. The region was sequenced, but because I used --min_length 10000 in my filtlong command, the sequnces were removed
# 4. The region was sequenced, but because I used --keep_percent 90 in my filtlong command, the sequnces were removed because AT-rich regions will inherently be of low-quality 
# 5. Maybe only the first 200 bp of the promoter is missing, and maybe the reason why the CDS and 3'UTR wasn't able to be sequenced was due to the long AT-repeat 1677 bp downstream of exon3

# I will attempt to clarify which of these is the case by carrying out the following in the order stated:
# 1. Redo the read filtering, using Nanofilt this time so that --headcrop can be utilized. Minimum read length will be set to 1 kb, and a minimum quality score of 10
# 2. From these new filtered reads, make a new bam file alignment to TrRv5 chromosome 8
  # If this still shows no sequence, then either the region was unable to be sequenced due to AT-content, or a 
  # recombination event has occurred and it is now somewhere else in the genome with different flanking regions relative to the flanking regions 
  # If it looks as if a recombination event has occured, then I need to make an entire genome assembly, and see where it has moved to, and 
  # therefore what the new flanking regions look like
